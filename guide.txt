HOW DO TO THE THING

BEFORE THE RUN:
1. Optimize your sens
    Go to your options.txt/standardoptions.txt
    Ctrl+C copy your mouseSensitivity setting
    Run OptimizeMySens.java with your input sens
    Paste the new sens into standardoptions.txt
2. Update ninjabrainbot to have my thing as an option
    You'll want to enter your sens in here somewhere

DURING THE RUN:
1. Throw your eye on full FOV and sens.
2. Look near-ish to the eye
3. F3+C
4. Pause
5. Set your FOV to minimum
6. Set your mouse sensitivity to yawn, then right arrow it once.
7. Trigger tall macro to 16384 instance height.
8. Unpause
9. Move to precise point
10. Count the number of subpixels/pixels offset you are
11. F3+C again
12. Enter your number of subpixels offset
13. Pause
14. Continue run as normal
